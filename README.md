## About

This map is showing the locations of New York City Capital Projects geocoded by community volunteers. This effort is ongoing as we attempt to assign a location to every capital project in the Capital Project Detail Data dataset.
The full dataset includes about 5,000 projects, at the time this readme was updated we have geocoded about 2000 projects, starting with "local" projects (those that are not categorized as "CITYWIDE" and have one or more community districts identified in "community boards served")

## Data

The data included in this project is joined at build time, and consists of the Capital Project Detail Data for Fiscal Year 2021, and the community-built lookup table of point geometries:
